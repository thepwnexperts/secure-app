## üìö `Modules`

1. **Secure Coding**
   - This module focuses on teaching secure coding practices, including best practices for writing secure code, identifying common vulnerabilities, and implementing defensive programming techniques.
   - [Secure Coding Repository](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/secure-coding)

2. **Impact Mitigation (Isolation)**
   - In this module, explore strategies for mitigating the impact of security breaches. Learn isolation techniques that help contain and minimize the consequences of security incidents.

3. **Misconfiguration**
   - This module focuses specifically on misconfigurations related to web applications and their impact on security. Learn about common web application misconfigurations that can expose vulnerabilities and understand how to identify and remediate them effectively.

4. **Secure Work Practices (e.g., .env on Server)(human errors)**
   - The module covers secure work practices, such as properly handling sensitive information like environment variables (.env) on the server. Protect sensitive data and avoid common security pitfalls during development.

5. **IDS/IPS**
   - Learn about IDS and IPS technologies that can actively monitor and respond to potential threats. Understand how to set up and configure these systems to enhance the security of your applications.

6. **Security Headers**
   - Highlight the importance of security headers for ensuring bare minimum and standard security measures in web applications.
